<h1 align="center">Design Patterns in C#</h1>

## ðŸ’» Project
This project has the goal to study design patterns implemented in C#. It's contain theory and code implementation.

## Structural

### Adapter ###
Adapter is a structural design patterns that allow incompatible classes to communicate. It's serves as well to create an anticorruption layer and to promote uncouple.
Examples: 
  - Different implementations of gateway that has to communicate with your domain that has different interface.
  - When you have legacy code and need to adapt to modern classes.

**PROS**:
- Single responsability: Separate the interface data from the business logic.
- Open closed principle: You can introduce new adapters without breaking the existing client, as long the contract of interface be preserved.

**CONS**:
- The complexity of code increases because you introduced a lot of new interfaces and classes.

**How to implement?**
- Create an interface that describes the contract the others classes should follow.
- Create the desired classes.
- Create the adapter for the desired classes that implements the interface.
- Add a reference to the class you need to adapt in the adapter class. It's common to use the constructor, but you can use when calling its methods.
- Client should use the adapter class to comunicate with internal classes.


## ðŸ§ª Techs

This project was develop with the following technologies:
