  <h1>Design Patterns in C#</h1>
</p>

## ðŸ’» Project
This project has the goal to study design patterns implemented in C#.

## Structural

**Adapter**
Adapter is a structural design patterns that allow different classes to communicate.
Ex: Different implementations of gateway that have to communicate with your domain that have different interface.

**PROS**:
- SINGLE RESPONSABILITY
Separate the interface data from the business logic.
- OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPLE
You can introduce new adapters without breaking the existing client, as long the contract of interface be preserved.

**CONS**:
- The complexity of code increases because you introduced a lot of new interfaces and classes.
